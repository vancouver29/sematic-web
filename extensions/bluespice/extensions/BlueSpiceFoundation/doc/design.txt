This is a brief overview of the new design of BlueSpice 2.0.

==General==
With BlueSpice 2 we tried to be more MediaWiki compliant. Therefore most of the
folders you know from MediaWiki appear in the BlueSpice* extensions. We now 
make use of ResourceLoader and populate the client side with a lot of useful 
information.

==ExtJS==
One core component is the ExtJS Rich Internet Applications JavaScript Framework
by Sencha [http://www.sencha.com/]. This allows us to create a very good user 
experience especially in business/enterprize wiki installations.

===ExtJS customizations/hacks===
Unforunately ExtJS comes with a very mean CSS reset. Is applies "x-body" class 
to the "body" HTML element on load and sets all the font to a size of 13px. 
This causes the standard Vector-Skin to have very tiny font sizes.

At the time of writing there was no posibility to prevent ExtJS from doing 
that. Therefore a hack was applied in the files

 resources/bluespice.extjs/bluespice-theme/bluespice-theme-all-debug.css
 resources/bluespice.extjs/bluespice-theme/bluespice-theme-all.css

that removes the CSS statement. As it is only applied in the custon ExtJS theme
"bluespice" this should not have any side effects. But if one wants to use the 
original "neptune" theme there might be troubles with font sizing.

===MediaWiki ExtJS Components===
In "resouces/bluespice.extjs/BS" you can find additional reusable components.

==TODO==
* Refactor the "outputhandler/views" files.
** Or better: replace usage of these with config arrays and "Html" class
* Redesign "BsConfig" mechanism
** Maybe rely on MediaWiki "SiteConfig"
